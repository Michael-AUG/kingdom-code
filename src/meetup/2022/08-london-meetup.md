Join Kingdom Code London for one of our regular community evenings together. On Monday, 15th August, from 7.30pm we'll be at The Trinity on Borough High Street for a quiet gathering with Christians in technology and innovation. The evening is super informal, no agenda, just come along and meet likeminded folk in the Kingdom Code community.

It's a 10 minute walk from London Bridge Station or a 0 minute walk from Borough Tube Station.
