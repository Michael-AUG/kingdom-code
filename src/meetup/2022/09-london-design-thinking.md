**Design and solution thinking have become buzzwords in many industries, creating an illusion that sticky notes will solve all things. But what are the values of the steps? Do they align with our Christian values?** Where do empathy and understanding users’ pain points meet our desire to love people as Jesus does? How does a call to serve one another well affect how we merge skill sets to tackle a problem?

Before BUILD, we’ll explore the innovation process and how it opens our minds to possibilities in the midst of challenges and projects. Whether you plan to participate in BUILD or not, please join us in September as we dig deeper into the design process.
