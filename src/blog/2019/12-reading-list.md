**From articles on the Financial Times about religion and technology, through to another [Kingdom Code BUILD](/build) project going live, the reading list this month is full of great posts to get stuck into.** Each month we're trying to dig out some of the best blog posts and news articles exploring the intersection of Christianity and technology.

## Religions show faith in power of technology

"_The Vatican is praying that this year’s must-have Christmas gadget will not be an Apple Watch or Kindle, but rather its eRosary device._" In this article on the FT website Eoin McSweeney digs into how different religions are using technology in different aspects of faith.

## The Digital <s>Revolution</s> Reformation

The Gospel Coalition calls itself as an "internet-based ministry". In this blog post they explore some of the challenges that doing ministry in a digital space presents, but also three opportunites that they see growing.

## Faith and Work

Recently Peter Wilkinson launched the [Faith in Freelancers site](https://faithinfreelancers.com/). Over on his blog he explores some of the ways in which he works to make God the centre of his working life as a freelance Wordpress dev rather than just something on the side.

### Missional Work Through a Hackathon

[BUILD](/build) happens as part of a world wide gathering of Christian technologists co-ordinated by [Indigitous](https://indigitous.org/). As part of the hackathons happening in October there were '_approximately 1,100 technologists, developers, designers, and mission workers in 37 cities and 26 nations around the world…_' That's huge! Read the blog post Indigitous pubished that shows some of the projects that were built in other hackathon sites taking part this year.

### Malaria Challenge Bot

Some projects worked on at BUILD [launch straight after the hackathon…](/blog/2019/go-chatter-custom-videos-dan-rackham/) others take a little bit more time to mature! The Malaria Challenge Chatbot was a project that was worked on in BUILD 2018, and shipped yesterday! In a very short blog post, Phil shows the chatbot. (There is a much longer read with more of [the background to the project on his blog too](https://www.philhewinson.com/2018/12/20/building-a-chatbot/)).

### Missional AI

Earlier this month James spoke with Daniel Whitenack who is one of the organisers behind the upcoming [Global Missional AI summit](https://www.missional.ai/) happening in Thailand in March 2020. In the blog post Daniel explains why a summit about AI and Global Mission needs to happen, and why you should consider going.

### Technology Will Save Us

Across the UK British Telecom has put up giant billboards with the slogan _Technology Will Save Us_. Ed takes a deeper look at what that line implies, and gives us some questions to think about as Christians working in the tech world.
