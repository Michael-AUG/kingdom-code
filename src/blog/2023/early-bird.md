Kingdom Code BUILD is back! 13–14th October at St. John’s Hoxton. A room full of technologists and innovators from across the UK (and sometimes further) gathering for a weekend together to worship God with the skills and tools that he has gifted us with.

> “I loved seeing and experiencing the Christ centred community coming together to build the Church.”
> – Philippa, first time attendee at BUILD ‘22

Whether you’re a designer, a developer, a project manager, or if you just bring buckets of enthusiasm, then we hope you will find BUILD an inspiring and welcoming environment where you can take time out of your day jobs to apply your skills to some of the challenges facing our local churches, communities, or ministries.

Early Bird tickets open on 28th June, so put it in your calendar and be sure to book promptly to take advantage of our discounted rate.

> “The most inspiring weekend of the year”
> – Mike, regular attendee

We look forward to seeing you soon
