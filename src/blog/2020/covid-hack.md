It seems a long time since I wrote the blog post on Monday about [serving the church during coronavirus](/blog/2020/covid-and-the-church/), let me encourage you again; **please get in touch with your church leaders and see how you can support them in this time**. Kingdom Code has been contributing to the [Digital Tools for churches during the Coronavirus](https://covid.churcheshandbook.co.uk). It's full of resources and how-to guides to get your church up and running digitally.

Our friends over at [Faithtech](https://faithtech.com/) have this beautiful line; _"in the midst of devastation there is an opportunity for innovation"_. As Christian technologists we're equipped to innovate, to serve, to design and build tools together that helps the Church do what she does best: bringing faith, hope and love to the world around us. As a result we're inviting you to join with a global hackathon of Christians in tech to innovate towards just that.

I'll let James Kelly from Faithtech introduce it:

How might we serve the body of Christ in this time? We were due to have in-person gatherings in London and Leeds over the next few weeks, some of those gatherings were to be microBUILD. Please join us here instead.
