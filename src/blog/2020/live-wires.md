**Electronics and the Bible. Video making and the prayer. Programming and fellowship. Graphics and teenagers. What do all these have in common? They are all part of a [LiveWires](https://www.livewires.org.uk), a [Scripture Union holiday](https://content.scriptureunion.org.uk/holiday/livewires) in Salisbury, for 12 to 15 year olds every summer.**

The first reaction I get when I tell people about LiveWires is normally _“I had no idea anything like that existed”_. So let me tell you a bit about it!

LiveWires has been running for nearly 20 years and though some things have changed a lot (like adding app development, running our programming course from Raspberry Pis rather than large beige desktops), the need of good Bible teaching for teenagers has not changed. Our aim is for the young people to grow in their relationship with God, or to get to know him for the first time. A lot of similar holidays for teenagers involve running around a field playing games. For most teenagers (and adults) they are happy with this, but LiveWires helps cater for those that enjoy doing something a bit different too.

Almost every day is the same and includes time studying the Bible in the morning and afternoon. This includes talks, individual and group Bible study, sung worship and prayer. Throughout the week the teenagers get to work on three different projects, these range from python and javascript programming, graphics and 3d modelling, video production, web design, audio recording, and some amazing electronics projects like building a theremin, light beam alarm, or 3D LED cube. Some young people have done a lot before and others it is their first time picking up a soldering iron or doing any programming. This gives a great opportunity for the team to work closely with the young people, teaching them new skills and having good conversations whilst working together.

For a lot of our young people, they may be the only one in their class or youth group that enjoys technical activities, but at LiveWires they realise there are other people like them. It is also an encouragement for them to see how the team can live out the Christian life in the technical jobs that many of them do for the other 51 weeks of the year.

The team is made up of volunteers that have a wide range of both technical, non-technical and church backgrounds. As an electronic engineering student and active in my university’s Christian Union, I was asked by a friend whether it's something I'd be interested in. Having been on team for many years now, the biggest encouragement is seeing how the young people grow in their faith as they come back multiple years. For many they have grown up going to church, but being away from home gives them a chance to start thinking about what owning their faith for themselves actually means. For others, it gives them a chance to ask the questions that they wouldn't ask their youth leaders at home. For some, it may be the first time they've heard the gospel themselves. We hope to give these young people tools and resources so that they can continue studying the Bible themselves when they get home.

These are 2 of the encouragements we had from parents last year:

> “My child came home absolutely buzzing about the Bible. They haven't stopped reading it!”.

> “Through your patient and prayerful ministry, our boy has heard God's call to follow him.”.

This year, LiveWires is 2nd to 9th August. If you would like more information or to book, go to [livewires.org.uk](http://www.livewires.org.uk). If you know young people that may be interested, then do pass the information on.
