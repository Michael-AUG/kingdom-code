We live in an age of anxiety. In a “normal” week, 6% of the population is struggling with anxiety. In a “pandemic” week, up to 62% of us are struggling with stress and fear. Often the first port of call in anxious moments is the smartphone: there we find information, techniques and community to spur us on. But the vast majority of apps are entirely secular – they provide worldly wisdom but not encouragement to turn to the Sovereign One who loves most and leads best.

The aim of this project is to design and deliver a Christ-centred app that is genuinely helpful to those struggling with anxiety. With sections providing information on the condition, activities to help manage the fears and hope from Scripture to edify even the most struggling heart, the vision is that it will be a one stop shop that marries biblical truth with medical insight. Clearly, it can never replace the role of GPs and therapists (and it would clearly signpost people to places of help – conscious that an app is never all a person needs) but it could be a first port of call and a reservoir of help for those whose anxiety is mild and those whose anxiety is severe.
