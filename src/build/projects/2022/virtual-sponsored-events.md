In a world before covid, Compassion previously took runners to developing countries to complete a challenge (half marathon, marathon, ultra-marathon, hike, cycle, etc) in country and fundraise for that area. The vision of the virtual challenge is to build life giving connection with other challengers, build healthy habits, build connection with the ministry and fundraise too.

The project would take all the goodness of existing virtual challenges (Strava integration, mapping, leader board & community chat, milestone celebrations, etc.) and layer on Compassion’s unique content.

The challenge would be located in one of the 25 developing countries Compassion have projects in. As a challenger progresses, they’d unlock content such as interviews and testimonies of participants and project teams. The challenge may start and / or celebrate completion with a virtual tour to the country and opportunity to meet representatives via zoom.
