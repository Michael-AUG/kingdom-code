Stewardship is on a mission to build a community of generous stewards uniting to use all God has given us to love Him, love one another, and love our neighbours as ourselves. One of these aspects is about encouraging Christians to think about their financial giving, and supporting them in that.

Last year Stewardship launched [Cause Finder](https://www.stewardship.org.uk/support-cause), a tool to help you support causes close to your heart. During BUILD we're going to think, explore, and prototype how to make this tool even better…

How might we improving how people can find what to give to? That might be…

- Thinking about advanced search based on themes, causes, people, etc
- Exploring what motivates people to give, and when you have searched for something pulling together a richer profile page
- Building on top of datasets beyond Stewardships, for example how might we marry this a profile page with data from the charity commission?
