ChurchSuite is a tool used in churches across the UK and beyond to support the smooth operation of the church, from setting up serving rotas through to communication to the whole church family ChurchSuite is there to help your church staff.

One of the side projects that has been running inside is a tool to gather and analyse personality test data (such as Working Genius, Myers Briggs, Enneagram) to help church teams identify and best use their God-given abilities. This weekend at BUILD how could we take the a static prototype and build it out into a tool which serves churches to help them work and serve together?
