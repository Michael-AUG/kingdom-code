PrayerMate is a tool used by thousands of Christians worldwide to help them pray. A long term request from many of the users is an improved editor to allow them to update their prayer requests away from their phone.

If you've got a heart to help people to pray, then this team could use your skills; whether that is the code of the tool, through to thinking through how people use it, designing the interactions, or thinking how the tools could be advertised and taught to the existing userbase…

Recently the Discipleship Tech team have worked to move the frontend of PrayerMate into [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), could Flutter for Web to a tool that they could hardness to build this new editor? Or… maybe a React/Vue frontend?
