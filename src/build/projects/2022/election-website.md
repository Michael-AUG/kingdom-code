Newcomers to Kingdom Code BUILD, CARE is a ministry which exists to bring a Christian viewpoint to the policies and laws in the United Kingdom. Every General Election, CARE produce materials to help Christians engage with the manifestos and policies which the different parties are putting forwards.

2024 seems a long way off, but that is an estimate of when the next General Election is going to be, and CARE want to be ready for it. CARE want to create the very best, interactive resource for Christians ahead of the next General Election to inspire, inform and equip them to show up, vote and engage effectively.

What could we design this weekend that would help people who have never engaged with politics before begin to explore it? How might we highlight some of the key topics that come up in the election, and equip Christians to pray, think, and talk about them well?
