Long time attendees of BUILD, Christians Against Poverty are passionate about ending poverty in the UK. As the UK faces in a sharp increase in the cost of living they are challenging us to think and explore how we might help people see and understand the impact of the cost of living on them.

This is a blank canvas project, we're looking for creative thinking, designing, and building to explore how the real impact the economic situation is going to have on people in the next months ahead to help them plan and budget.
