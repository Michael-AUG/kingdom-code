GoChatter is a ministry that has been coming to BUILD for many years now. back in 2017 Dan suggested the ideas of creating a tool to enable churches to quickly customise videos for their social media, and 24 hours later their [custom video tool was created](https://gochattervideos.com/christmas/custom-videos-from-previous-years/). Over the years BUILD has been a weekend which has helped them improve the UX on their website, reduce the AWS build, and ultimately help them serve churches better.

This year they are back and looking to help with their custom gif generation tool for social and email marketing - one of the big aims of this tool is to support the ministry of Go Chatter Videos with a viable revenue stream. It's a tent-making venture â€” so they need people who are great at sewing canvas! Like Paul made tents to fund his ministry, GoChatter need to branch out to use our video technology for a wider market to keep the ministry going.

Everything that has happened at BUILD in previous years has gone into production either at the event or shortly after: so your work here will have an immediate impact!
